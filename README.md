N-Body Particle Gravitational Attraction Simulation

I am experimenting with C++ and I need to be able to upload and/or compare newer updates to this project.

NOTE: I am having some trouble with a function in C++, where the class member function for adjusting the acceleration is not modifying any values to the class member variable <acceleration>, with either that function giving an error or it simply produces no change at all.
As a result, I have taken the project and converted it into a Python file, which CAN perform the necessary operations on the class member variables; so, therefore, the remainder of this project looks like it will be done in PYTHON to keep things flowing towards a completed project. Once complete in Python, I will try to go back to the original C++ file and work out the issue as described above.

Additionally, I think in the Python file, I will include a Tkinter module or some other graphical interface to visually display the data of the simulation by plotting the Particle objects to a GUI. I'm not sure how effective or simple it would be to reverse-engineer this back into a C++ equivalent, but the option to do it in Python is much more easily and readily available, so I might as well continue in that direction, since that was effectively one of the final goals of the project anyway.
